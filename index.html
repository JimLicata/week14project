            <h2>Game 1</h2>
            <a href="page1.html">
                <img src="page1.png" alt="game 1 picture">
            </a>
            <p>Very simple game of just collecting monsters from made from a simple canvas tutorial. Use the arrow keys to move
                and collect monsters.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="page2">
            <h2>Game 2</h2>
            <a href="page2.html">
                <img src="page2.png" alt="game 2 picture">
            </a>
            <p>Slightly more complex take on game 1. All sprites have been replaced and now the space bar must be used to attack
                the monsters instead of simply colliding with them.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="page3">
            <h2>Game 3</h2>
            <a href="page3.html">
                <img src="page3.png" alt="game 3 picture">
            </a>
            <p>Considerably more complex than both game 1 and 2. Now the monster moves around and can damage the player. Move
                around and attack with space like before, but now there is also a chance that the monster can drop a heart
                upon defeat to replenish one life point. The game ends when the player runs out of life.
