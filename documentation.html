        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>
            I used canvas in order to make my game possible. I found a very simple tutorial for making the basic concept of what I wanted
            to do, then I went through the code figured out what everything did, and modified it to make it into a much more
            complex game.
        </p>
        <h2>What I had to learn</h2>
        <p>
            I had to learn exactly what each piece of code did so that I could modify it meaningfully. This required a lot of trial and
            error, as well as much frustration, but in the end I now understand my project front and back and can make many
            modifications at will. This included ripping and implimenting other sprites of my choice, as well as calling
            different sprites during runtime depending on the user's inputs. I also had to learn how to change the hit detection
            so that there were separate hitboxes between the sword and the player so that the game knows whenever to kill
            the monster or hurt the player. I was also able to learn how to write my own javascript functions and implement
            them into the game. This included writing a function that is called every time a monster is killed to determine
            whether or not a heart should spawn or not. And going off of that, I had to learn how to create a heart object
            in the first place that would spawn and have its own properties by simply seeing what the base code I had did,
            and rewriting it so that it fit my needs. The original version the game would also reset after each collision
            with an enemy, so I had to manipulate that code to make it so that this was not the case, and that only the monster
            would reset. I wanted to also make it so that the game could end, so I had to add different game states so that
            there could be lose conditions and ultimately a gameover screen that stops the game, changes the background,
            and displays the player's score. The last thing I had to learn was to add basic enemy AI so that the enemy could
            move around without wondering out of the bounds of the game. This required a lot of work since the original code
            wasn't designed for the enemy to even move at all, but in the end, I think it turned out how I wanted. The one
            thing that I unfortunately did not get to work were animations. I really wanted to have the hero character and
            monster be animated so that their sprites cycled when they were moving, but that involves timing that I'm not
            sure how to use properly in canvas, and just led to the character disappearing completely, so I had to remove
            it. Even so, I'm happy with how the final version turned out, and I'm glad I was able to implement most of the
            ideas I had intended to.
        </p>
        <h2>Above and beyond</h2>
        <p>
            I do feel that I have gone above and beyond with this project due to the amount of complex modifications I made and added
            to this code that weren't covered in class, or even in the tutorial I had used. I had to pull outside knowledge
            from exeperiences I had in other classes in order write basic AI, or manipulate collisions, or spawn entirely
            different objects with different properties. And to do this in a coding language that I'm mostly unfamiliar
            with and not used to required a great deal of effort and patience.
